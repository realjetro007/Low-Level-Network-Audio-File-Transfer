This is my introduction to python's socket library as a Year 13 student.

This library taught me how to set up client server models and send messages between them using python.

For this example I have created a client server relationship that deconstructs a mp3 file down to binary and sends it by internet protocals over to the client where it is then reconstructed into the full mp3.

This is just a proof of concept and I will likely not continue to develop this.
